# Hourglasses-in-2d-array
Task: Finding the maximum sum of the possible "hourglasses" in a 2 dimensional array. This task is taken from HackerRank. You can see the full condition in the 3 pages added.
I changed it a little bit in the way the user to be aasked to add the 2 dimensional array by himself and then to see it materialized before the answer of the task to be calculated.
