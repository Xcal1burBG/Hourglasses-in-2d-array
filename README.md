# Hourglasses-in-2d-array
Task: Finding the maximum sum of the possible "hourglasses" in array. This task is taken from HackerRank. You can see the full condition in the 3 pages added.
I little bit changed it in the way the user to be aasked to add the 2 dimentional array by himself and then to see it materialized before to calculate the answer of the task.
